	<h1>The Concepts of Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is how much an algorithm is efficient in terms of time taken by that algorithm for the complete execution of the program to get a desired result.</p>
	<p>Space Complexity is how much space or memory is required by the algorithm to complete its execution to get a desired output. The space complexity is measured in terms of O(n)</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity </b>should be optimum so that the program do not get stacke over flow exception. </p>
